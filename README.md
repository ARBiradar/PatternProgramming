# ⭐ Pattern Programming (Interview-Oriented)

This repository contains a **comprehensive collection of pattern programming problems** commonly asked in **coding interviews**, **college exams**, and **technical assessments**.

The goal of this project is to strengthen **logical thinking**, **loop mastery**, and **problem-solving skills** by practicing a wide variety of patterns.



## 📌 What is Pattern Programming?

Pattern programming involves printing **structured outputs** using:
- Stars (`*`)
- Numbers (`0–9`)
- Alphabets (`A–Z`)
- Symbols

Patterns are built using **nested loops**, **conditions**, and **row–column logic**.

---

## 🎯 Why Pattern Programming is Important for Interviews?

Interviewers use pattern problems to test:
- Understanding of **loops**
- Ability to convert **logic into code**
- Control over **nested iterations**
- Attention to **spacing and formatting**

> 💡 Strong pattern logic reflects strong fundamentals.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts Covered:**  
  - `for` / `while` loops  
  - Nested loops  
  - Conditional statements  
  - Mathematical logic

## ⭐ Pattern Categories Covered

## 1️⃣ Star Patterns

Star patterns are the **most frequently asked** pattern problems in interviews.

### ✔ Square Pattern
Prints stars in equal rows and columns.

```

---

---

---

---

```

---

### ✔ Right-Angled Triangle
Stars increase row by row.

```

*
* *

---

---

```

---

### ✔ Inverted Right Triangle
Stars decrease row by row.

```

---

---

* *
*

```

---

### ✔ Pyramid Pattern
Stars form a centered pyramid.

```

*
* *

---

---

```

---

### ✔ Inverted Pyramid
Reverse of pyramid pattern.

```

---

---

* *
*

```

---

### ✔ Diamond Pattern
Combination of pyramid and inverted pyramid.

```

*
* *

---

* *
*

```

---

### ✔ Hollow Star Patterns
Stars printed only on the borders.

```

---

* ```

  ```
* ```

## 2️⃣ Number Patterns

Number patterns test **mathematical thinking** along with loops.

### ✔ Increasing Number Triangle
```

1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4

```

---

### ✔ Repeated Number Pattern
```

1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4

```

---

### ✔ Continuous Number Pattern
```

4 5 6
7 8 9 10

```

---

### ✔ Palindrome Number Pattern
```

1
2 1 2
3 2 1 2 3

```

---

## 3️⃣ Alphabet Patterns

Alphabet patterns check **ASCII understanding** and loop control.

### ✔ Alphabet Triangle
```

A
A B
A B C
A B C D

```

---

### ✔ Repeated Alphabet Pattern
```

A
B B
C C C
D D D D

```

---

### ✔ Alphabet Pyramid
```

A
B B
C C C
D D D D

```

---

## 4️⃣ Mixed Patterns (Advanced)

These patterns combine **stars, numbers, and spaces**.

### ✔ Number + Star Combination
```

1 *
2 * *
3 * * *

```

---

### ✔ Binary Pattern
```

1
0 1
1 0 1
0 1 0 1

```

---

### ✔ Pascal’s Triangle
```

```
1
```

1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1

## 🧠 Core Logic Used in All Patterns

- **Outer loop** → Controls rows  
- **Inner loop** → Controls columns  
- **Spaces** → Control alignment  
- **Conditions** → Control shape  

> 🔑 Visualize first, then code.
